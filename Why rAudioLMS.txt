## Using Tidal

- In LMS, go to Server menu, Basic Settings, and choose mysqueezebox.com.
- Add your mysqueezebox account (Tidal should be added beforehand). Tidal will appear with a logged-in status.

### If you don't have an account yet:

- Previously, to link Tidal via mysqueezebox.com, you needed to use a VPN for a foreign location.
- If you don't have a mysqueezebox account, go to mysqueezebox.com, create an account, and add Tidal under Apps.
- You can use the Opera browser (with VPN enabled) to create a mysqueezebox.com account and add Tidal.
- Afterwards, use a regular browser to access mysqueezebox.com and log into Tidal.
- You only need to perform this setup once. If you change Tidal accounts, add it again.

## Apps for Control

- You can use the rAudio Android app.
- Alternatively:
  - For Android: Fully Kiosk Browser & Lockdown
  - For iOS: Kiosker: Fullscreen Web Kiosk

- Add your device's IP, for example: 192.168.1.2:9000 or raudio.local:9000.
- These apps allow displaying a fixed webpage. Once added, it's readily available on subsequent launches (full screen).
- Each time you open the app, it displays the LMS Material interface.
- LMS Interface + Kiosk = App Control

## Enhance Your Experience

You can install this setup on an Android box to turn your TV screen into a display for your Pi.
